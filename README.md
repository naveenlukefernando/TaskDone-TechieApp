# TaskDone


When living in the society we need the support of thousands of services to solve the problems we come across in our day-to-day life. This extends from household to the administration of institutions.

We have provided a simple and quick solution for customers to locate service providers (workers) who have a relatively low capacity for promoting their services. We named our project as “TaskDone”.

‘TaskDone’ is a service app which brings in service provider easily to the customers' doorstep for their needs. As an example, there are electricians, air-conditioners, plumbers, painters, cleaners and many others which can be hired through the app.

#Features

• With TaskDone app installed on a user’s smartphone, a technician is only a tap away.

• The client can choose a preferred technician based on their ratings or let the app automatically find a service provider or worker nearby.

• The technician's location will be shown on the map, and the user’s on the technician's map when you request his service.

• The worker can get feedback and reviews (so every user can quickly find the best service provider)

• Flexible Payments
  - Online payment or cash
